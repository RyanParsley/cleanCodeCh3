# Small

> Therefore, the indent level of a function should not be greater than one or two

???
Anecdote about 8 space tabs in the linux kernel as a means to avoid nesting.

---
# Small

> Every function in this program was just two, or three, or four lines long. Each was transparently obvious. Each told a story. And each led you to the next in a compelling order. That’s how short your functions should be!

???
Aspire to this, but don't beat yourself up when you miss.

---
# Small

```typescript
const isEven = n => n % 2 === 0
```

---
# Do One Thing 

> FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING.
> THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL.
> THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY.

???

You may not be all in on functional programming, but it's largely compatible
with this chapter. 

---
# Do One Thing

And isn't _necessarily_ the enemy

```typescript
const sortOddDescendingAndEvenAscending = 
  (unsortedNumbers: number[]): number[] => [
    ...(unsortedNumbers || []).filter(isOdd).sort(sortDescending), 
    ...(unsortedNumbers || []).filter(isEven).sort(sortAscending)
  ]
 ```
 
???
We have and right there in the title, but this function does one thing.

It sets the stage for the other functions to do their thing.

---
# One Level of Abstraction

---
# Switch Statements

It’s also hard to make a switch state- ment that does one thing. By their nature, switch statements always do N things. 

---
# Switch Statements

At least entertain the idea that you may want to refactor your logic. 

---
# Descriptive Names

---
# Function Arguments

> The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero (niladic).

# Function Arguments

Martin is in the right ballpark, but had an off by one error.

---
# Have No Side Effects

Martin is so close to advocating for functional programming in this book

---
# Command Query Separation

---
# Prefer Exceptions to returning Error Codes

---
# Don't Repeat Yourself

Consider inverse logic as potentially duplication in disguise. 

---
# Structured Programming

Yeah, don't do this. Eagerly returning is an awesome way to clean up logic.

# How do you write functions like this?

Go to Carnegie hall and turn around.
